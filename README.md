# Conformal_Prediction
Conformal Prediction Intervals are a non-parametric way to achieve prediction intervals with valid finite sample guarantees for arbitrary regression problems, e.g. neural networks, gradient boosting , etc. 
In this code repository we test the validity of the finite sample garauntees by running some large scale regression problems using LightGBM and regularized linear methods and use simulation to test the coverage of the conformal method.
